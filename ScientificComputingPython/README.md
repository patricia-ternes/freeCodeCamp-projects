# Scientific Computing with Python

In this folder you will find my solutions for 5 projects that make up the [Scientific Computing with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python) at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Description

> In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.
